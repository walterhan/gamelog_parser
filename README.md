# bball_gamelog_parser
Gamelog parser to get out player shot data.

Only stuff in here right now is an exploratory notebook session on a sample test url.

Next steps are to turn that into a class/set of methods to work on any gamelog on bball reference. Ideas are the 3 following things:
* Method or class to retrieve gamelogs (urls) based off of team and a set of dates
* Method or class to deal with turning basic gamelog data into a raw data frame of information direct from bball ref
* Method or class to turn mangle this raw data fram into data suitable for analysis on shot selection/frequency
